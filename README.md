### Task Outline

 During this project, I will be overlooking the existing html and css files and continually altering the anatomy of the code. Most of the changes made to the code follow a certain guideline, that increases the code's accesibility to other web developers. The guidline includes implementing semantic html elements, ensuring that the code follows logical structuring, applying accesible alt attributes, and making sure that both the header and footer tags are properly organized.

### Implementing Semantic Elements

 The div class = "header" tag, for example, can be replaced by a semantic header tag. Since the initial code had a div class = "header", the css code had corresponding .header functions. To ensure that the external webpage remains the same, the css functions got changed from .header to header. 
 
 The same changes are also made to the div class = "footer" tag. 
 
 Furthermore, div tags in the body are replaced by semantic section elements and the div class in the header is replaced by nav elements.

### Logical Structuring of HTML

 The html code was reviewed to ensure all of the html elements follow the proper structure. Header tags contain subtags between h1-h6, section tags are chronologically ordered based on the external website, and the subsections follow the same structure.

### Alt Elements in Img Tag

 The img tags in the contents and benefits sections are updated to include alt placeholder tags with the same name as the images.

### Heading Attributes 

 The most important thing about heading elements is that there sequentially ordered. According to the restructured code, the h tags flow from h1 to h3 as you scroll down the page. 

<a name = "#title-attributes"></a>

### Title Attribute

 Finally, the current title of the webpage, denoted as website, is changed to "Horiseon: Your Premier Marketing Agency" to better reflect the company's position.
